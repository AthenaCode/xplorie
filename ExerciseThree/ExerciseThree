Assuming that both solutions are correct, I would choose the first developer's code to keep in the codebase. The main reason for why I would choose the first developer's over the second is the readability of the first developer's code. While the computer is always able to read the code, it is important to make sure that it's easy for the engineers to read the code in order to maintain it and add to the codebase. Something that I would suggest would be to add notes to let other engineers know how the code works and what it accomplishes.
